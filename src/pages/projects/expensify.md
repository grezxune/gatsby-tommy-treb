Expensify is a project I created while I was learning React on [Udemy](https://udemy.com). This app allows you to login with your google account and stores its data in Firebase. It is a fairly simple app allowing you to record expenses. You can also search for specific entries, and filter based on date.

It is a simple, but useful app if all you need to do is keep track of your spending.
