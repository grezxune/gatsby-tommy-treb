I created this version of PlayFree to solve a problem of my own. I play pool all the time, and know all the places in my home town that offer free pool on each day of the week. When I moved to the town over, I had no idea where to find places to play free pool. This was the problem, and I thought there was a very large market here and it was in great need of a solution. PlayFree was born!

I am currently in the process of re-creating it with more features and it will start in the form of a mobile application with a website to follow.
