BitBelt is a project I created for my dad's business Hilltop Woods, LLC. out of Amherst Wisconsin. They build beautiful custom cabinetry and various other woodworking projects.

They needed a simple software product to generate a cut list of pieces for the shop. This process used to be done by hand on every single cabinet opening on a project (sometimes upwards of 70)! With this software, they are able to enter in the data for each opening and generate all of the calculated measurements in minutes instead of hours!
